# Information needed to download other data

The "data_envir" folder in this repository only contains the data for MPAs (because som of these data (notably the info for the Weffell Sea MPA are not as available and well stored as the others). 
For all other data used in this study (expect krill ctach data), you can download them with the following information:

- KRILLPODYM biomass density: download the output of the last KRILLPODYM iteration (file “krill_biomass_20101229.nc") at https://data.imas.utas.edu.au/attachments/d14f679c-41d0-442f-a080-aa1947cefd6d/files/ 
- OCIM outputs: download the OCIM2-48L output at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14802732.v1 
- Other environmental data (oxygen, temperature and mixed layer depth) can be found on Copernicus platform: https://marine.copernicus.eu/, more specifically download the GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_BGC_001_029 product stored at DOI : 10.48670/moi-00019 for oxygen; and download the GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030 product at DOI: https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021 for the temperature and mixed layer depth.

- For MPAs data, the boundaries of existing MPAs (the South Orkney Islands MPA and the Ross Sea MPA) were downloaded from CCAMLR’s github repository (https://github.com/ccamlr/data/blob/main/geographical_data/mpa).
- For the “Project Weddell MPA phase 1”, its boundaries were constructed using the map of MPAtlas.org and the meeting document untitled “Proposal to establish a Marine Protected Area across the Weddell Sea region (Phase 1)” that can be requested here : https://meetings.ccamlr.org/en/ccamlr-38/23.

- Finally the krill fishing data that support the findings of this study are available from the Convention on Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Restrictions apply to the availability of these data, that are only available upon request from the secretariat of the CCAMLR.
