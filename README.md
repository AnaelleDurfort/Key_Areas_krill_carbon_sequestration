## Abstract  
Antarctic krill plays a key role in the ocean carbon cycle, particularly in long-term sequestration, and also supports an important commercial fishery with around 400,000 tons of krill harvested each year. Yet, the spatiotemporal distribution of the krill-mediated carbon sequestration across the Southern Ocean have been under-investigated. So, we investigated patterns of krill-mediated carbon sequestration as well as spatial overlap with Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and fishing grounds, to help identify priority areas for future research and management. More precisely, we defined a typology of three different zones based on spatially resolved estimates of krill density and carbon sequestration time, each being a critical component of krill-mediated carbon sequestration. Among these zones, Key Areas for Krill-mediated carbon Sequestration (KAKS), which combines high krill density and high carbon sequestration time, were identified as the areas where krill contribute most strongly to carbon sequestration; they cover 7.1x106 km² so 16.8% of the Southern Ocean. These KAKS are marginally covered by established Marine Protected Areas (4.8%). Yet, proposed MPAs may provide higher representativeness of this critical carbon sequestration pathway, up to 20.6% if all proposed MPAs are implemented. Furthermore, we found that almost all krill catches are concentrated in high krill density areas, with low to medium sequestration times. Overall, our results aim to contribute to inform spatial planning in the Southern Ocean with the dual objective of conserving biodiversity and carbon sinks.


## Open Reaserch Statement:
The code and most of the data used in this study are publicly available.

The scripts that support the findings of this study can be found in the “Key_Areas_krill_carbon_sequesration” git hub repository at https://github.com/AnaelleDurfort/Key_Areas_krill_carbon_sequestration/releases/tag/version_submited_V2 . A repository release is also available in a Zenodo repository https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14865682 .

The data were derived from the following resources available in the public domain: 
-	KRILLPODYM biomass density: download the output of the last KRILLPODYM iteration (file “krill_biomass_20101229.nc”) at https://data.imas.utas.edu.au/attachments/d14f679c-41d0-442f-a080-aa1947cefd6d/files/

-	OCIM outputs: download the OCIM2-48L output at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14802732.v1 
-	Other environmental data (oxygen, temperature and mixed layer depth) can be found on Copernicus platform: https://marine.copernicus.eu/, more specifically download the GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_BGC_001_029 product stored at DOI : 10.48670/moi-00019 for oxygen; and download the GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030 product at DOI: https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021 for the temperature and mixed layer depth. 
- For MPAs data, the boundaries of existing MPAs (the South Orkney Islands MPA and the Ross Sea MPA) were downloaded from CCAMLR’s github repository (https://github.com/ccamlr/data/blob/main/geographical_data/mpa). For the “Project Weddell MPA phase 1”, its boundaries were constructed using the map of MPAtlas.org and the meeting document untitled “Proposal to establish a Marine Protected Area across the Weddell Sea region (Phase 1)” that can be requested here : https://meetings.ccamlr.org/en/ccamlr-38/23. 
 - Finally the krill fishing data that support the findings of this study are available from the Convention on Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Restrictions apply to the availability of these data, that are only available upon request from the secretariat of the CCAMLR.

Files that can be downloaded online from a reliable source have not been duplicated and stored in the Zenodo repository to avoid creating unnecessary duplicates. Only files relating to AMPs have been integrated into the repository because the source of this information is not stable over time.
