## Abstract  
Antarctic krill play an important role in the ocean carbon cycle, in particular in carbon sequestration. are They are under an important commercial fishery with around 400,000 tons of krill harvested each year, that may affect the associated carbon sink. Yet, the spatial variability of krill-mediated carbon sequestration, as well as the overlap with the fishery is still poorly known. Here, using spatially resolved estimates of krill biomass density and carbon sequestration time, we identified key areas for krill-mediated carbon sequestration (KAKS) which cover 7.9x106 km²  of the Southern Ocean. We found that 30% of krill catches have occurred in these KAKS since 1988. In addition, we identified Conflicting Oceanic Carbon Areas (COCA) with the krill fishery, defined as the areas with combining the most efficient carbon sequestration and the highest krill catch density, representing areas where krill fishing may have the most impacts on krill-mediated carbon sequestration. These COCA represent 7.3% of the highly efficient sequestration areas over the period 1988 – 2023We also showed that the spatial extent of COCA has decreased over the past few decades, as the krill fishery has become more concentrated, while the absolute number of catches, has increased. Furthermore, we found that the representative system of Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in the Southern Ocean poorly covers the regions where krill contribute most strongly to carbon sequestration with only 3.7% of KAKS currently under protection. Implementing a proposed MPA in the Weddell Sea could significantly protect krill carbon sequestration as it would overlap at 67% with KAKS, raising the protection level of Southern Ocean KAKS to 15%. Finally, we provide recommendations for a carbon-smart management of the krill fishery, as our results aim to inform spatial planning in the Southern Ocean with the dual objective of conserving biodiversity and carbon sinks. 


## Open Reaserch Statement:
The code and most of the data used in this study are publicly available.
In this github reprository you will find the script that supports the findings of this study. 
The repository release made at the moment of publication is also stored in a Zenodo repository (DOI: ).

Description of the data used in this study thar are available in the public domain:
-	KRILLPODYM biomass density: download the output of the last KRILLPODYM iteration (file “krill_biomass_20101229.nc) at https://data.imas.utas.edu.au/attachments/d14f679c-41d0-442f-a080-aa1947cefd6d/files/ 
-	OCIM outputs: download the OCIM2-48L output at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14802732.v1 
-	Other environmental data (oxygen, temperature and mixed layer depth) can be found on Copernicus platform: https://marine.copernicus.eu/, more specifically download the GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_BGC_001_029 product stored at DOI : 10.48670/moi-00019 for oxygen; and download the GLOBAL_MULTIYEAR_PHY_001_030 product at DOI: https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021 for the temperature and mixed layer depth.  
- For MPAs data, the boundaries of existing MPAs (the South Orkney Islands MPA and the Ross Sea MPA) were downloaded from CCAMLR’s github repository (https://github.com/ccamlr/data/blob/main/geographical_data/mpa). For the “Project Weddell MPA phase 1”, its boundaries were constructed using the map of MPAtlas.org and the meeting document untitled “Proposal to establish a Marine Protected Area across the Weddell Sea region (Phase 1)” that can be requested here : https://meetings.ccamlr.org/en/ccamlr-38/23. 

Finally the krill fishing data that support the findings of this study are available from the Convention on Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). Restrictions apply to the availability of these data, that are only available upon request from the secretariat of the CCAMLR.

Files that can be downloaded online from a reliable source have not been duplicated and stored in the Zenodo repository to avoid creating unnecessary duplicates. Only files relating to AMPs have been integrated into the Zenodo repository in case the sources of this information are not stable over time.
